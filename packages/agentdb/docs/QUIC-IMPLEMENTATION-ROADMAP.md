**Status**: Approved

### ADR-002: Hybrid Conflict Resolution
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Vector clocks for episodes, CRDTs for skills, OT for edges
**Rationale**: Different data types have different conflict characteristics
**Alternatives Considered**: Single strategy (LWW for all)

### ADR-003: Hub-and-Spoke Default Topology
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Decision**: Default to hub-and-spoke, mesh as opt-in
**Rationale**: Simplicity, single source of truth, easier debugging
**Alternatives Considered**: Mesh-first, hierarchical
