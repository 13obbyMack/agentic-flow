## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Vector Search CLI Command Failures

**Severity:** 🔴 HIGH
**Impact:** User-facing CLI features broken
**Tests Failed:** 4/38

**Problem:**
```bash
# Tests 20-22: Vector search with different metrics
❌ vector-search with cosine similarity
❌ vector-search with euclidean distance
❌ vector-search with dot product

# Test 28: MMR diversity ranking
❌ vector-search with --mmr flag
```

**Root Cause:** CLI command `vector-search` likely has:
- Missing command registration in CLI
- Incorrect argument parsing for vector input
- Missing metric parameter handling

**Recommendation:** Verify CLI command registration in `src/cli/agentdb-cli.ts`

### Issue 2: Integration Test Memory Issues

**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Impact:** Test reliability
**Tests Failed:** 9/18 integration tests

**Problem:**
```
❌ Memory Persistence: should persist skills
❌ Memory Persistence: should persist causal edges
❌ Error Handling: invalid episode data
❌ Causal Recall: certificate generation
❌ Nightly Learner: pattern discovery
❌ Skill Consolidation: pattern extraction
❌ Explainable Recall: certificate details
❌ Explainable Recall: provenance lineage
```

**Root Cause:** "out of memory" errors in test environment
- Possible memory leak in test setup/teardown
- Missing database cleanup between tests
- Large data fixtures consuming too much memory

**Recommendation:**
- Add proper cleanup in test afterEach hooks
- Reduce fixture data size
- Implement database connection pooling in tests

### Issue 3: CausalMemoryGraph Table Missing

**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Impact:** Causal memory features
**Tests Failed:** 3/20

**Problem:**
```
SqliteError: no such table: main.episodes
```

**Root Cause:** Schema initialization issue in CausalMemoryGraph tests
- Missing schema migration for episodes table
- Test setup not initializing frontier schema

**Recommendation:** Ensure frontier schema loaded in test setup

### Issue 4: Browser Bundle WASM Loading

**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Impact:** Browser bundle tests
**Tests Skipped:** 35/35

**Problem:**
```
RuntimeError: Aborted(Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory,
  open 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sql.js@1.13.0/dist/sql-wasm.wasm')
```

**Root Cause:** Network access restricted in test environment
- Cannot download WASM file from CDN during tests
- Need to mock or bundle WASM file locally

**Recommendation:** Add local WASM file to test fixtures

### Issue 5: Minor Test Logic Issues

**Severity:** 🟢 LOW
**Impact:** Test accuracy
**Tests Failed:** 4/428

**Problems:**

1. **ReflexionMemory similarity score range**
   ```
   Expected: similarity >= 0 and <= 1
   Actual: -0.082 (negative cosine similarity)
   ```
   *Fix:* Normalize cosine similarity to [0, 1] range or update test expectations

2. **getCritiqueSummary "no failures" check**
   ```
   Expected: "No prior failures"
   Actual: Returns actual failures from test data
   ```
   *Fix:* Test setup should clear previous failures or adjust assertion

3. **getSuccessStrategies "no successes" check**
   ```
   Expected: "No successful strategies"
   Actual: Returns actual successes from test data
   ```
   *Fix:* Similar to critique summary issue

4. **LearningSystem empty state handling**
   ```
   TypeError: Buffer.from() received undefined
   ```
   *Fix:* Add null/undefined check before buffer conversion
