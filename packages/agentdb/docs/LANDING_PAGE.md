## 🎯 Frontier Memory Features (v1.2.1)

### 1. 🔄 Reflexion Memory
**Learn from experience with self-critique and episodic replay**

Store complete task episodes with self-generated critiques, then replay them to improve future performance. Like a personal coach that remembers your wins and losses.

```bash
# Store episode with critique
agentdb reflexion store "session-1" "fix_auth_bug" 0.95 true \
  "OAuth2 flow worked perfectly" "login failing" "fixed tokens" 1200 500

# Retrieve similar episodes
agentdb reflexion retrieve "authentication issues" 10 0.8

# Get critique summary (learn from failures)
agentdb reflexion critique-summary "fix_auth_bug" true
```

**Benefits:**
- 📚 Learn from successes AND failures
- 🎯 Build expertise over time through episodic memory
- 🚫 Avoid repeating mistakes with self-critique

---

### 2. 🎓 Skill Library
**Auto-consolidate successful patterns into reusable skills**

Transform repeated successful task executions into parameterized skills that can be composed and reused. Like building a personal programming library from experience.

```bash
# Create a reusable skill
agentdb skill create "jwt_auth" "Generate JWT tokens with expiry" \
  "const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); ..."

# Search for applicable skills
agentdb skill search "authentication" 5

# Auto-consolidate from successful episodes
agentdb skill consolidate 3 0.7 7
```

**Features:**
- 🤖 Automatic skill extraction from successful episodes
- 🔍 Semantic search for applicable skills
- 📊 Usage tracking and success rate monitoring
- 🧹 Automatic pruning of underperforming skills

---

### 3. 🔗 Causal Memory Graph
**Intervention-based causality with p(y|do(x)) semantics**

Learn cause-and-effect relationships between agent actions, not just correlations. Uses Pearl's do-calculus and doubly robust estimation to discover what interventions lead to which outcomes.

**A/B Experimentation:**
```bash
# Create experiment
agentdb causal experiment create "test_coverage" "add_tests" "code_quality"

# Record observations (numeric outcomes required)
agentdb causal experiment add-observation 1 true 0.85   # treatment group
agentdb causal experiment add-observation 1 false 0.65  # control group

# Calculate uplift with statistical significance
agentdb causal experiment calculate 1
```

**Automated Discovery:**
```bash
# Discover causal patterns from history
agentdb learner run 3 0.6 0.7

# Query discovered edges
agentdb causal query "add_tests" "code_quality" 0.7 0.1 10
```

**Use Cases:**
- 🐛 Understand which debugging strategies fix bugs
- ⚡ Learn what code patterns improve performance
- ✅ Discover what approaches lead to success

**What You Get:**
- Treatment mean, control mean, uplift
- 95% confidence intervals
- Statistical significance (p-value)
- Sample size tracking

---

### 4. 📜 Explainable Recall with Certificates
**Provenance tracking with cryptographic Merkle proofs**

Every retrieved memory comes with a "certificate" explaining why it was selected, with cryptographic proof of completeness using Merkle trees.

```bash
# Retrieve with explanation certificate
agentdb recall with-certificate "successful API optimization" 5 0.7 0.2 0.1
```

**Certificate Contents:**
- 🔐 Cryptographic proof (SHA-256 Merkle root)
- 📊 Retrieval parameters (k, α, β, γ)
- ✅ Completeness score (0.0-1.0)
- ⏱️ Query latency
- 🎯 Retrieved memory IDs with scores

**Benefits:**
- 🔍 Understand why memories were selected
- ✓ Verify retrieval completeness
- 🐛 Debug agent decisions
- 🤝 Build trust through transparency

---

### 5. 🎯 Causal Recall (Utility-Based Reranking)
**Smart retrieval combining similarity, causality, and latency**

Standard vector search returns similar memories. Causal Recall reranks by actual utility:

**Utility Formula:**
```
U = α·similarity + β·uplift − γ·latency
```

```bash
# Retrieve what actually works (not just what's similar)
agentdb recall with-certificate "optimize response time" 5 0.7 0.2 0.1
#                                                          ^ α   β   γ
```

**Parameters:**
- **α (alpha)**: Weight for semantic similarity (default: 0.7)
- **β (beta)**: Weight for causal uplift (default: 0.2)
- **γ (gamma)**: Penalty for execution latency (default: 0.1)

**Why It Matters:**
- ✅ Retrieves what **works**, not just what's **similar**
- ⚖️ Balances relevance with effectiveness
- ⚡ Accounts for performance costs
- 🎯 Optimizes for real-world utility

---

### 6. 🌙 Nightly Learner (Automated Discovery)
**Background process that discovers patterns while you sleep**

Runs automated causal discovery on episode history, finding patterns you didn't explicitly program.

```bash
# Dry-run to see what would be discovered
agentdb learner run 3 0.6 0.7 true

# Actual discovery (creates skills + causal edges)
agentdb learner run 3 0.6 0.7

# Prune low-quality patterns
agentdb learner prune 0.5 0.05 90
```

**Features:**
- ⏰ Asynchronous execution (run overnight)
- 🔗 Discovers causal edges automatically
- 🎓 Auto-consolidates successful patterns into skills
- 🧹 Prunes low-quality patterns
- 📊 Doubly robust causal estimation

**What It Discovers:**
- Causal edges between memory types
- Successful skill patterns
- Statistical significance (p-values)
- Uplift measurements

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### Vector Search (150x Speedup)

AgentDB uses **WASM SIMD** for ultra-fast vector operations:

- **Parallel computation** across multiple dimensions
- **Cache-efficient** memory access patterns
- **Zero-copy** embeddings (binary BLOBs)
- **Batch processing** for bulk operations

### Causal Inference

Based on Pearl's do-calculus and intervention semantics:

1. **Uplift Estimation**: Treatment vs Control comparison
2. **Statistical Testing**: T-tests with confidence intervals
3. **Doubly Robust Learning**: Combines regression + propensity scoring
4. **Confounder Detection**: Tracks correlation patterns

### Cryptographic Certificates

Provenance proofs using Merkle trees:

1. **Hash each retrieved episode** (SHA-256)
2. **Build Merkle tree** from hashes
3. **Generate root certificate** (cryptographic proof)
4. **Store proof** with retrieval metadata
