## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Use QUIC instead of WebSocket/gRPC
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ✅ Approved
**Location**: QUIC-ARCHITECTURE.md, Section 8

**Decision**: Use QUIC (HTTP/3) as transport protocol

**Rationale**:
- Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking
- 0-RTT connection establishment (< 50ms)
- Built-in TLS 1.3 encryption
- Connection migration for mobile agents
- Better loss recovery than TCP

**Alternatives Considered**:
- WebSocket: Lacks multiplexing, head-of-line blocking
- gRPC: Less efficient for mobile/edge scenarios

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Performance benefits significant for multi-stream sync
- ✅ Future-proof protocol (HTTP/3 standard)
- ⚠️ Less ecosystem maturity than WebSocket
- ⚠️ May need UDP proxy in some networks

---

### ADR-002: Hybrid Conflict Resolution (Vector Clocks + CRDTs + OT)
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ✅ Approved
**Location**: QUIC-ARCHITECTURE.md, Section 8

**Decision**: Use different conflict resolution strategies for different data types

**Strategy Mapping**:
- **Episodes**: Vector Clock + Last-Write-Wins
  - Rationale: Episodes are mostly immutable
- **Skills**: CRDTs (G-Counter, LWW-Register, OR-Set)
  - Rationale: Skills have collaborative updates that should merge
- **Causal Edges**: Operational Transform
  - Rationale: Complex semantics require transformation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single LWW strategy for all types (simpler but loses data)
- All CRDTs (too complex for simple cases)

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Optimal strategy per data type
- ✅ Reduces manual conflict resolution by 95%+
- ⚠️ Higher implementation complexity
- ⚠️ Team needs distributed systems expertise

---

### ADR-003: Hub-and-Spoke Default Topology
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ✅ Approved
**Location**: QUIC-ARCHITECTURE.md, Section 8

**Decision**: Default to hub-and-spoke topology, allow mesh as opt-in

**Rationale**:
- Simple conflict resolution (single source of truth)
- Easier monitoring and debugging
- Sufficient for most deployments (10-1000 nodes)
- Mesh adds unnecessary complexity for majority of users

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Mesh-first: Too complex for most use cases
- Hierarchical: Overkill for < 1000 nodes

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Simpler implementation and operations
- ✅ Faster time to market
- ⚠️ Single point of failure (mitigated by server redundancy)
- ⚠️ Central server bandwidth bottleneck at scale (mitigated by load balancing)

---

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Performance First
- **Target**: < 100ms sync latency (P95)
- **Target**: > 10,000 episodes/s throughput
- **Target**: < 50ms connection setup (0-RTT)
- **Strategy**: QUIC multiplexing, compression, batching

### 2. Security by Design
- **Layer 1**: mTLS for transport security
- **Layer 2**: JWT for API authorization
- **Layer 3**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Layer 4**: Network firewalls and rate limiting
- **Layer 5**: Audit logging and compliance

### 3. Conflict-Free by Default
- **Episodes**: Deterministic resolution with vector clocks
- **Skills**: Automatic merge with CRDTs
- **Edges**: Intelligent transformation with OT
- **Goal**: > 95% auto-resolution rate

### 4. Scalability
- **Small**: 10-100 nodes (hub-and-spoke)
- **Medium**: 100-1000 nodes (hub-and-spoke with load balancing)
- **Large**: 1000+ nodes (hierarchical topology)

### 5. Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus for all key metrics
- **Dashboards**: Grafana for visualization
- **Alerts**: Automated alerting for anomalies
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for debugging

**Solutions**:
- Enable compression (threshold: 10KB)
- Increase batch size (up to 1000)
- Optimize database indexes

#### Issue: Conflict Storm
**Symptoms**: > 10 conflicts/min
**Possible Causes**:
- Network partition
- Clock skew between nodes
- Concurrent updates to same records
**Solutions**:
- Check network connectivity
- Sync system clocks (NTP)
- Review update patterns (reduce concurrent writes)

#### Issue: Connection Failures
**Symptoms**: Repeated connection drops
**Possible Causes**:
- Certificate expiration
- JWT token expiration
- UDP port blocked
**Solutions**:
- Rotate certificates
- Refresh JWT tokens
- Verify firewall rules (allow UDP 443)
