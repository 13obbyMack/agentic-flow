## 💡 Testing Philosophy

Our test suite follows industry best practices:

1. **Test Pyramid:** Many unit tests, fewer integration tests, focused E2E tests
2. **Fast Feedback:** Unit tests run in <5 seconds
3. **Isolation:** Tests don't depend on each other
4. **Realistic Data:** Use production-like test datasets
5. **Performance First:** Benchmarks run on every PR
6. **Continuous Validation:** Automated CI/CD pipeline
