# Phi-4 Training Monitor - Active

## 🚀 Deployment Status: RUNNING

**Project**: ruv-dev
**Service**: phi4-finetuning-gpu
**Region**: us-central1
**GPU**: NVIDIA L4

### 📊 Training Pipeline

The system is now running the complete fine-tuning pipeline:

1. **Phase 1: Baseline Benchmarks** (~15 min)
   - Tests original Phi-4 model
   - Measures tool calling accuracy
   - Records performance metrics

2. **Phase 2: Fine-tuning** (~4-6 hours)
   - LoRA training with r=32, alpha=64
   - 5 epochs with early stopping
   - 60-100 training examples
   - Target: >95% tool accuracy

3. **Phase 3: Validation** (~10 min)
   - 20 validation test cases
   - Tool detection, correctness, parameters
   - Quality tier assessment

4. **Phase 4: Post-Training Benchmarks** (~10 min)
   - Compare baseline vs fine-tuned
   - Performance improvements
   - Tool-by-tool breakdown

5. **Phase 5: Email Notification**
   - Sends results to: **ruv@ruv.net**
   - Includes all metrics and next steps

### 📧 Email Will Include:

- ✅ Training duration
- ✅ Tool accuracy achieved (target: >95%)
- ✅ Parameter accuracy (target: >90%)
- ✅ Quality tier (EXCELLENT/GOOD/NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT)
- ✅ Improvement metrics vs baseline
- ✅ Next steps (HuggingFace upload if successful)

### 🔍 Monitoring

Background monitor is checking status every 5 minutes and will notify when complete.

You can also manually check:
```bash
# View monitor output
tail -f /workspaces/agentic-flow/agentic-llm/monitor-training.log

# Check Cloud Run logs
gcloud run logs tail phi4-finetuning-gpu --region us-central1 --project=ruv-dev
```

### ⏱️ Expected Completion

**Start Time**: ~17:40 UTC
**Expected End**: ~23:00-01:00 UTC (5-7 hours)

### 💾 After Training

If tool accuracy >95%, upload to HuggingFace:
```bash
python3 cloudrun/upload_to_huggingface.py --repo-name phi4-mcp-tools-optimized
```

Model will be available at: `https://huggingface.co/YOUR_USERNAME/phi4-mcp-tools-optimized`
