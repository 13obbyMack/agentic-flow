# Deployment Status Update

## Issue Encountered: Out of Memory

The initial deployment (16GB RAM) ran out of memory during container startup.

### Fix Applied:
- Increased memory: 16GB â†’ **32GB**
- Increased CPU: 4 â†’ **8 vCPUs**
- Redeploying now...

### Why This Happened:
The Phi-4 model + dependencies + PyTorch + CUDA libs require significant memory even before training starts. The 16GB limit was hit during container initialization.

### Current Status:
âœ… Secrets created and configured
âœ… Permissions granted
âœ… Container built successfully
ðŸ”„ Redeploying with 32GB RAM

### Next:
Once deployed, training will automatically start:
1. Baseline benchmarks (~15 min)
2. Fine-tuning (~4-6 hours)
3. Validation (~10 min)
4. Post-benchmarks (~10 min)
5. Email to ruv@ruv.net

**Expected completion**: ~6-8 hours from now
**Cost**: ~$25-30 (higher due to 32GB RAM)
