  },

  // Post-prediction: Store results for learning
  postPrediction: async (prediction, accuracy) => {
    await hooks.postEdit({
      file: 'predictions.json',
      memoryKey: 'climate/results'
    });
  },

  // Continuous learning: Analyze patterns
  learning: async () => {
    return await hooks.neuralTrain({
      patternType: 'prediction',
      trainingData: 'climate/historical'
    });
  }
