## The Question

**Does consciousness affect quantum measurement outcomes?**

Popular theories like "quantum consciousness" and "observer effect" suggest that human awareness influences quantum events. This project provides the first rigorous experimental test of this claim.

## The Answer (Expected)

**No.** Quantum mechanics predicts that measurement outcomes depend only on the physical measurement apparatus, not on whether the observer is human, machine, or even present. We will test this prediction with unprecedented precision.

## What We'll Do

### 1. Theoretical Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Formalize the **Observer-Agnostic Measurement Theorem** mathematically:
- Prove that measurement probabilities p(y|Œª) are independent of observer identity
- Derive testable predictions: singles invariance, no retrocausality
- Document falsification criteria

### 2. Computational Simulation (Weeks 2-4)
Build a Rust-based quantum simulator to:
- Compute exact predictions for delayed-choice quantum eraser
- Verify singles remain flat (p(0) = p(1) = 0.5) regardless of measurement basis
- Generate reference datasets for experimental comparison

### 3. Experimental Test (Weeks 6-20)
Conduct photonic quantum eraser experiment with:
- **Entangled photon pairs** generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)
- **Three controller types:**
  - Human (keyboard button presses)
  - Quantum RNG (true randomness)
  - Deterministic (pre-programmed algorithm)
- **15 million detection events** across all controllers
- **Blinded protocol:** Controller identities hidden until after analysis

### 4. Statistical Analysis (Weeks 21-22)
Test the null hypothesis:
- **H0:** Singles probabilities are identical for all controller types (within Œµ = 5√ó10‚Åª‚Å¥)
- **Tests:** Chi-squared (no deviation) and TOST equivalence (tight bounds)
- **Result:** Either confirm null (expected) or detect violation (revolutionary)

### 5. Publication (Weeks 23-24)
Publish peer-reviewed paper with:
- Open data (DOI-archived on Zenodo)
- Open code (MIT license on GitHub)
- Complete reproducibility documentation
- Target: Physical Review Letters or Physical Review A

## Expected Outcomes

### Most Likely Result (95% probability): NULL RESULT

**Finding:** No difference between human, RNG, and deterministic controllers.

**Implications:**
- ‚úÖ Confirms standard quantum mechanics
- ‚úÖ Rules out "quantum consciousness" hypotheses with precision 5√ó10‚Åª‚Å¥
- ‚úÖ High-impact negative result (first rigorous test)
- ‚úÖ Publishable in top-tier physics journal

**Example Result:**
```
Singles Probabilities:
  Human:         p(0) = 0.500123 ¬± 0.000047
  Quantum RNG:   p(0) = 0.499887 ¬± 0.000051
  Deterministic: p(0) = 0.500045 ¬± 0.000043

Chi-squared test: œá¬≤ = 2.31, p = 0.51 (no significant difference)
TOST equivalence: All pairs equivalent within Œµ = 5√ó10‚Åª‚Å¥
```

**Conclusion:** Observer identity does not affect quantum measurement.

### Revolutionary Result (5% probability): VIOLATION DETECTED

**Finding:** Statistically significant difference between controller types.

**Implications:**
- üö® Discovery of new physics beyond standard quantum mechanics
- üö® Evidence for consciousness-matter interaction
- üö® Requires immediate independent replication
- üö® Paradigm shift in quantum foundations

**If this happens:**
1. Verify no systematic errors (drift, selection bias, hardware artifacts)
2. Conduct independent replication immediately
3. Contact theoretical physicists for mechanism modeling
4. Submit to Nature or Science (discovery-level result)
