# Migration Status: Zero Build Tools

## ✅ COMPLETE: AgentDB v1.4.3

**Published**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentdb

### What Works
- ✅ **ZERO native dependencies**
- ✅ Uses sql.js (WASM) exclusively
- ✅ Installs in ANY environment (GitHub Codespaces, Docker, etc.)
- ✅ No Python, Make, G++, or SQLite libraries required
- ✅ All features working (reflexion, causal memory, skill library, etc.)

### Test
```bash
npx agentdb@latest db stats
# ✅ Works perfectly with NO build errors!
```

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "^1.20.1",
    "chalk": "^5.3.0",
    "commander": "^12.1.0",
    "sql.js": "^1.13.0",  // ✅ WASM SQLite - no build tools
    "zod": "^3.25.76"
  },
  "optionalDependencies": {}  // ✅ EMPTY
}
```

## ⚠️ PARTIAL: agentic-flow v1.8.1

**Published**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-flow

### What Works
- ✅ Core orchestration features
- ✅ Uses AgentDB v1.4.3 (zero build tools)
- ✅ Removed @xenova/transformers, onnxruntime-node, @huggingface/inference from dependencies

### What Doesn't Work Yet
- ❌ Local ONNX providers require manual installation:
  - `onnx-local` provider → needs `npm install onnxruntime-node`
  - `onnx-phi4` provider → needs `npm install @huggingface/inference`
  - Local embeddings → needs `npm install @xenova/transformers`

### Why
The agentic-flow package has optional LOCAL inference features that require native dependencies. These were in `optionalDependencies`, but that causes npx to try building them.

**Current state**: These providers will gracefully fail if dependencies aren't installed, directing users to install them manually.

---

## Summary

### For Users Who Want ZERO Build Issues:

✅ **Use AgentDB directly**: `npx agentdb@latest`
- Works in ANY environment
- No build tools needed
- All memory/learning features available

### For Users Who Want agentic-flow:

⚠️ **Use agentic-flow v1.8.1**: `npx agentic-flow@latest`
- Core features work
- Local ONNX features require manual `npm install onnxruntime-node @xenova/transformers @huggingface/inference`
- Use cloud providers (Anthropic, OpenRouter, Gemini) for zero-build experience

---

## Recommendation

**Option 1** (Zero build, recommended for most users):
```bash
npx agentdb@latest  # Database/memory features
npx agentic-flow@latest --provider anthropic  # Use cloud LLM
```

**Option 2** (Local inference, requires build tools):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruvnet/agentic-flow
cd agentic-flow/agentic-flow
npm install  # Installs optional deps if you have build tools
npm run build
```

## Technical Details

### What We Fixed in AgentDB v1.4.3:
1. Removed `@xenova/transformers` from dependencies
2. Made embedding service handle missing transformers gracefully
3. Removed `better-sqlite3` entirely (keywords, dependencies, optionalDependencies)
4. Updated all TypeScript imports to use `db-fallback.ts` (sql.js wrapper)
5. Changed Database types from `better-sqlite3` to `any` with fallback

### What Remains in agentic-flow:
1. Optional ONNX providers (onnx-local.ts, onnx-local-optimized.ts, onnx-phi4.ts)
2. These files import onnxruntime-node and @huggingface/inference
3. TypeScript compilation requires stub types or the actual packages installed
4. Solution: Keep them, but make them truly optional (fail gracefully)

## User Request Fulfillment

> "both agentic-flow and agentdb don't have better-sqlite3"

✅ **AgentDB v1.4.3**: ZERO better-sqlite3 references
⚠️ **agentic-flow v1.8.1**: No better-sqlite3, but has other optional native deps

**Partial success**: AgentDB is perfect. agentic-flow needs further work to make ONNX providers truly optional without build errors.
