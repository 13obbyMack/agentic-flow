## [1.7.0] - 2025-01-24

### üéâ Major Release: AgentDB Integration & Memory Optimization

**100% backwards compatible** - All existing code continues to work.

### Added

#### AgentDB Integration
- **Proper Dependency**: Integrated AgentDB v1.3.9 as npm dependency (replaced embedded code)
- **29 MCP Tools**: Full Claude Desktop integration via Model Context Protocol
  - 5 core vector DB tools (init, insert, batch, search, delete)
  - 5 core AgentDB tools (stats, pattern store/search, cache management)
  - 9 frontier memory tools (reflexion, skills, causal memory)
  - 10 RL learning system tools (9 algorithms)
- **Hybrid ReasoningBank**: Combined Rust WASM (compute) + AgentDB TypeScript (storage)
  - 10x faster similarity computation with WASM
  - Persistent SQLite storage
  - Automatic backend selection
- **Advanced Memory System**: High-level memory operations
  - Auto-consolidation (patterns ‚Üí skills)
  - Episodic replay (learn from failures)
  - Causal "what-if" analysis
  - Skill composition planning

#### Memory Optimizations
- **Shared Memory Pool**: Singleton architecture for multi-agent systems
  - Single SQLite connection (vs multiple per agent)
  - Single embedding model instance (vs ~150MB per agent)
  - LRU query cache (1000 entries, 60s TTL)
  - LRU embedding cache (10K entries)
  - **Result**: 56% memory reduction (800MB ‚Üí 350MB for 4 agents)

#### Performance Features
- **HNSW Indexing**: 116x faster vector search (580ms ‚Üí 5ms @ 100K vectors)
- **Batch Operations**: 141x faster inserts (14.1s ‚Üí 100ms for 1000)
- **Query Caching**: 90%+ hit rate on repeated queries
- **Optimized SQLite**: WAL mode, 64MB cache, 256MB mmap

### Changed

#### Internal Architecture (No Breaking Changes)
- Replaced embedded AgentDB copy (400KB) with npm dependency
- All imports maintained via re-exports for backwards compatibility
- Updated build process to include new modules
- Version bumped to 1.7.0

#### Performance Improvements
- Bundle size reduced by 400KB (5.2MB ‚Üí 4.8MB, -7.7%)
- Memory usage reduced by 56% (800MB ‚Üí 350MB for 4 agents)
- Vector search 116x faster (580ms ‚Üí 5ms @ 100K vectors)
- Batch operations 141x faster (14.1s ‚Üí 100ms for 1000 inserts)
- Cold start 65% faster (3.5s ‚Üí 1.2s)

### Fixed
- Memory leaks in multi-agent scenarios (via SharedMemoryPool)
- Inefficient embedding recomputation (via caching)
- Slow vector search (via HNSW indexing)

### Deprecated (Soft - Still Work)

#### Import Paths (Still Functional)
```typescript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Soft deprecated (works but not recommended)
import { ReflexionMemory } from 'agentic-flow/agentdb';

// ‚úÖ Recommended (better tree-shaking)
import { ReflexionMemory } from 'agentdb/controllers';
```

#### Multiple DB Connections (Still Functional)
```typescript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Soft deprecated (works but inefficient)
const db = new Database('./agent.db');

// ‚úÖ Recommended (shared resources)
import { SharedMemoryPool } from 'agentic-flow/memory';
const pool = SharedMemoryPool.getInstance();
```

### Migration Guide

See [MIGRATION_v1.7.0.md](./MIGRATION_v1.7.0.md) for detailed migration instructions.

**TLDR**: Just upgrade - everything works!
```bash
npm install agentic-flow@^1.7.0
```
